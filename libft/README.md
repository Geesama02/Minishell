# Project Overview


The Libft project challenges students to reimplement several essential C library functions from scratch, allowing them to deepen their understanding of memory management, data structures, and function design. By creating a custom library, students learn to build reliable and efficient code, which forms the basis for future projects within the 42 curriculum.

# Key Features
Core C Functions: Reimplementation of standard C functions such as memset, strcpy, strcat, strcmp, and more.
Additional Utilities: Custom functions for string manipulation, memory operations, and linked list management.
Coding Standards: Strict adherence to 42's coding standards, including memory leak prevention, code readability, and consistent style.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error checking and handling to ensure robustness.

# Getting Started
To clone this repository and get started with the Libft project:

    git clone https://github.com/Geesama02/Libft.git
    cd libft
    make
  
The Makefile provided in the repository helps compile and build the library. You can include this library in other projects as a starting point for your C programming journey.

# Learning Objectives
Memory Management: Understanding dynamic memory allocation and manual memory management in C.
Data Structures: Working with linked lists and other foundational data structures.
Code Quality: Following best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
# Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Ensure that your code adheres to the 42 coding standards.
